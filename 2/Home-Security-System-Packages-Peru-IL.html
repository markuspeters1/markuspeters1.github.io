The process by which an alarm company gets signals from an alarm system and relays an alarm dispatch request to the town for the function of summoning law enforcement action to the alarm website.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

<p>Possible robbers by and big prefer easier targets with the least amount of danger included. Homeowners also often install fake security cameras utilizing the exact same reasoning.
