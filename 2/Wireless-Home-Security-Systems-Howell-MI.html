<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
