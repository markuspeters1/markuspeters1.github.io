Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
