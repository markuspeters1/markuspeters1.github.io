Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
