<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
