The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
