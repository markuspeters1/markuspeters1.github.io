<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the producer's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit limited to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to use too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though.
