Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Because it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it just gets triggered when it captures motion from something giving off infrared energy, i.e., animals and individuals. Moreover, it does not get set off by small objects. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most innovative motion sensors that eliminate all incorrect alarms and only gets activated when individuals approach it.</p>
