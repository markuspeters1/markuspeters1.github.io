<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building.

Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
