Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in some cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance score are the most resilient. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options because their design allows for minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will offer more accurate and less regular alerts.</p>
