<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive method to robbery decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
