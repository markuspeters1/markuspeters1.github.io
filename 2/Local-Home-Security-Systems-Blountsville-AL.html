<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not consisted of in this new law. These alarms differ from panic alarms, which are covered.

<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>
