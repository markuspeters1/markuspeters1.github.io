<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
