Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies each time you walk by.

<p>Although 1080p is typically the standard resolution for cameras we've evaluated, there are advantages to models with higher-resolution sensing units. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however practically all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things plainly.</p>
