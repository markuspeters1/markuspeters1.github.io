The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including smart things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
