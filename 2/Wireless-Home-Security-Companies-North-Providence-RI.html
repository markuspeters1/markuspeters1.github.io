<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas.

You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might find out to be mindful about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers.
