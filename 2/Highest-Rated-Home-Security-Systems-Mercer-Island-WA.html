Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
