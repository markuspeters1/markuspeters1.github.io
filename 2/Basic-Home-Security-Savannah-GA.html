<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>This nifty smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget.
