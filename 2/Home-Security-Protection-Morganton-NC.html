<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
