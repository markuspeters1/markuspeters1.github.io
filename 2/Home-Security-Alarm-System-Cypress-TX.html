We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top spots.

IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
