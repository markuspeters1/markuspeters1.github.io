<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize too (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are variety issues.</p>
