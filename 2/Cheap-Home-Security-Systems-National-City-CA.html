<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, fraud, and vandalism. Idea: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again react to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of costly false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to frighten prospective burglars.</p>
