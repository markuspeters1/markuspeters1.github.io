<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and a phenomenal worth. It receives an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is detected. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a regular camera image.

However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it likewise brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and use up a lot of taping storage space. A lot, in truth, that they require about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is important.</p>

You can add service month-by-month or annually. Smart-home integration: Smart-home compatibility enables you to expand a device's abilities (either now or in the future) by linking camera functions with other clever devices.
