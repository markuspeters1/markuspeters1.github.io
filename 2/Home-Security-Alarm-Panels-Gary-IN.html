<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and a phenomenal worth. It receives an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.
