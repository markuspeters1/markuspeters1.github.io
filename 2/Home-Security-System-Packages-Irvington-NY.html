<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System in New York</h3>
<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.

Bluetooth cameras are likewise easy to install, but you have to stay within 40 feet or so to link to them with your phone.</p>
