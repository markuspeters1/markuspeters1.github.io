<p>Everybody we dealt with at NSS were extremely helpful and accommodating. The services they offered were precisely what we wanted, and they carried out with professionalism and proficiency.

Still, you're right about the Arlo Pro refraining from doing anything to keep rain from hitting the lens cover.</p>

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.

For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the initial fee.
