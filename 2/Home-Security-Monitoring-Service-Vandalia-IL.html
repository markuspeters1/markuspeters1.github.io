The average length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements might span up to 60 months or 5 years.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, our company believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
