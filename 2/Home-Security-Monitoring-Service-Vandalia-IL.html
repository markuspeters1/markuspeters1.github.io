Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, our company believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
