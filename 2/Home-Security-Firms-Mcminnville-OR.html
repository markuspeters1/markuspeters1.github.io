You might invest a similar amount for the best home security system, but they don't monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel. However, they're the best home security cameras if you're searching for active monitoring. One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which could be an inexpensive choice for customers in backwoods. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available.
