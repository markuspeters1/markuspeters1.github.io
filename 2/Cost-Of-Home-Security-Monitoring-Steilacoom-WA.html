<p>After ordering, setting up, and using these systems for eight months, we found 4 standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all provide an exceptional client experience and instinctive, innovative security tech. We 'd be comfy outfitting our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a specific area.
