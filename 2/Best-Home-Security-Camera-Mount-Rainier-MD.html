And it can be released indoors or out. The Brinks Home Security system is available in two bundle choices. The Home Complete model is $29 each month.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
