The camera can tape video in as much as 1080p, which looks perfectly great on a smart device screen and won't tax your internet connection excessive.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
