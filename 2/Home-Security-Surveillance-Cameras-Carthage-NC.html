<h3>Residential Security Alarm Systems in Carthage NC</h3>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
