<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas.

As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
