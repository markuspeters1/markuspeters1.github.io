<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the exact same smarts and more detailed 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , because its image quality is still outstanding, and it's slightly better value - though its rate is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the money is all the usual Arlo characteristics in terms of the solid build quality, outstanding camera video, tons of smart features and a sleek app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
