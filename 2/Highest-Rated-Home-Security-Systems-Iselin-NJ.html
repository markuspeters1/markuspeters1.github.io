<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of straight plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cables. DVR systems are challenging to scale up since when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to acquire an entirely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the linked cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to break down.</p>

Frequently, the mere existence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated trespassers. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or harmed by the more figured out intruders. They might also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks if intruders can not see any security cameras.</p>
