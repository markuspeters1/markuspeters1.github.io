<p>In the evening, though it lacks the complete IR LED range of some competitors, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're positioning it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not only is the Arlo fast to select moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at.

It has about 25 feet of exposure during the night. As such, even if someone breaks into your home in total darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your mobile phone app. The only concern here is that the taped video will be white and black and a little dark so you might not have the ability to see information clearly.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each.

And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the month-to-month strategy, the latter of which is waived for the very first year. However if you want the absolute best when it pertains to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
