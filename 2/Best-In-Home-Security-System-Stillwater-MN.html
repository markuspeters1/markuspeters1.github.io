The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, therefore we might revisit this review.

<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we tested, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.
