<p>This clever clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when motion was spotted. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
