<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Wireless security cameras take advantage of your home or organisations WiFi connection to develop a surveillance network.

We go more in depth on wireless security cameras here.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics given that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life by far.

<p>Because it can be challenging to find power sources for outside cameras, we like that the Ring Spotlight Camera has three power choices: battery, hardwired, or solar.

Home security is extremely important, so do not be tempted to take any shortcuts when it comes to picking a design.
