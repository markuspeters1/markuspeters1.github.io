<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>Analog high definition cameras are a fantastic option for businesses to update from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired utilizing coax cable television or CAT-5 cable. AHD cameras use the same RG59 or RG6 cable television as traditional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable television with video baluns can also be used. While pro monitoring costs more, it's more secure.

Regrettably I bought 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is actually excellent. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
