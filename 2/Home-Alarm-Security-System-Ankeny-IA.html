<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
