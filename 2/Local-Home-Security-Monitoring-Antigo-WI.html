Both the initial Abode system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we evaluated that likewise works with HomeKit.

<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the precise same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which means. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>

Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to by hand eliminate to move the information? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
