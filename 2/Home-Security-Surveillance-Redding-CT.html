<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. Audio and video confirmation techniques utilize cameras and microphones to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image snapshots. The source audio and video streams are sent over a communication link, generally an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the main station where monitors obtain the images through proprietary software. The details is then passed on to police and recorded to an event file, which can be utilized to prepare a more tactical and strategical technique of a residential or commercial property, and later as prosecution evidence.</p>
<p>Everybody we handled at NSS were very valuable and accommodating. The services they supplied were exactly what we wanted, and they performed with professionalism and proficiency. I'm not exactly sure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, particularly during the night when weather conditions really mess with the night vision.

<p>The security systems I have actually developed and executed are strictly for monitoring activity of a prospective target, whether from a terrorist risk or neighborhood thieves or vandals.
