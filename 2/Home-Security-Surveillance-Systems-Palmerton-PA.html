ADT utilizes an independent distributor design including third-party dealerships. The dealerships determine which equipment to utilize. Expenses for systems differ. Bigger systems that offer full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most costly alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most economical choice.</p>
<p>A common reason for a user to purchase a wireless security system is to upgrade from an older, hardwired system.
