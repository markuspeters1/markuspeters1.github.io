<h3>Home Security Cameras in North Carolina</h3>
<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it ought to be. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
