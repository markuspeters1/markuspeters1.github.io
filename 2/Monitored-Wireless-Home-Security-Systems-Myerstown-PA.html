You can even combine numerous cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Remember that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However given that most retail theft would not journey an alarm anyway (an employee slipping some additional money while giving a client modification, for example), we believe it's more crucial to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you require.
