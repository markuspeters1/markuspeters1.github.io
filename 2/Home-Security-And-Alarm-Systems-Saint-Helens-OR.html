<p>Field of view: Many security cameras use a wide-angle lens, while baby screens and nanny web cams typically use a more narrow range of vision to focus on the infant. We haven't checked Eufy's security cameras yet so we'll take your recommendation into factor to consider. We actually like the Eufy video doorbell, so I imagine we'll evaluate the security cameras soon. SimpliSafe is not excellent at clever home support.

It doesn't deal with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we don't anticipate it to include additional functionality anytime quickly.</p>

Something else to keep an eye out for: All-in-one Do It Yourself security gadgets created for smaller sized homes and living areas.
