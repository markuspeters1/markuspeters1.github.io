'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side.

But I likewise value minimalist systems that parts that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation available to you. Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, smart lock, and so on), I wish to ensure that they all easily interact with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
