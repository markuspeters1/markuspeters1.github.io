However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
