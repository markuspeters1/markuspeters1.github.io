<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, fraud, and theft. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically turn off the heating systems. You can automatically make the clever lights turn on to terrify away possible burglars if the motion sensors are activated.</p>
<p>Though the majority of our attention these days is focused on the transition to IP video technology, it's important to keep in mind that analog CCTV security cameras can still be extremely reliable for many surveillance applications, especially those on a budget plan. With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transmitted in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring location. But that does not suggest you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to utilize your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

<p>When motion is identified, nearly all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensing unit that will set off the camera to tape video.

For an additional layer of security, search for a camera with sound detection that can let you know if someone is out there even if they're out of series of the camera lens and the motion sensing unit. Fair warning: You'll most likely need to fine-tune the sound sensitivity settings to prevent alerts from barking dogs, loud vehicles, and other random noises.</p>
