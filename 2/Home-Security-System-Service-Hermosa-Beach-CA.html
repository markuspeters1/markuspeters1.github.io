Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you intend to save and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video footage. The video is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
