SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would signal users when it identified any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be a perfect storm of scenarios for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the issue.
