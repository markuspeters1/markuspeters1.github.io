Hard drive storage is safe, secure, and practical, with many systems offering expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll need to by hand eliminate to move the information? Does it go to your smart device, or upload to services like Dropbox?
