<p>Nearly all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will activate the camera to tape-record video when motion is discovered. The sensor can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is occurring, and some will also produce an e-mail alert. For an additional layer of security, try to find a camera with sound detection that can let you understand if somebody is out there even if they run out range of the camera lens and the motion sensor.

<p>ADT authorized provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand name does not otherwise charge up front for a system it says deserves $1,300.

ADT utilizes an independent distributor model including third-party dealers. The dealers identify which equipment to use. Expenses for systems differ. Larger systems that use full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most expensive options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most cost effective choice.</p>

The system can be set up to communicate via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
