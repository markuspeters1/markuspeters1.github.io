<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy Do It Yourself installation, other companies offer (and sometimes need) professional installation.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
