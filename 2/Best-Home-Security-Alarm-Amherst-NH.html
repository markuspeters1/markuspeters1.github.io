<p>Fill out a protection and the type 1 or ADT Professional will call you, from time to time, about Protection 1, ADT and Lifeshield deals. You could invest a comparable amount for the very best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. However, they're the best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring.

We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>
