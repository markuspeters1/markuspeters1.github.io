We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year agreements!

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
