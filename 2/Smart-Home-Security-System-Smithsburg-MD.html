<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great alternative for long range scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>

<p>Obvious and untidy wires running across walls and floorboards are an eyesore - despite the scenario. Thankfully, security system manufacturers appear to have actually figured this issue and resolved it through wireless security cameras.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

When going for a wireless security system installation, all these factors need to be taken into factor to consider.
