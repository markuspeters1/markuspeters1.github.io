<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
