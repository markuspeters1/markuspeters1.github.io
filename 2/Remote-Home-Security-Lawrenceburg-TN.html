<p>When it concerns innovation, reliability is a highly subjective matter, depending on which features and advantages a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, however low signal strength and poor connection are still typical complaints. Hardwired systems require minimal maintenance, and short of a basic power outage, are more difficult to disrupt. In spite of a general enhancement in wireless technology, there seem fewer methods for hardwired systems to be interfered with and crippled.</p>
<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a must for usage when you're far from home, but you shouldn't need to fumble with your phone when you're reoccuring.
