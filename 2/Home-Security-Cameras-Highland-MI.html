<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stick with them longer, because switching monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>No false alarm charges: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the police for an incorrect alarm. Because the house owner supervises of the system, authorities are just contacted if there's a genuine emergency situation. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will get in touch with authorities if a property owner can't validate an incorrect alarm. If  police are gotten in touch with for a false alarm, property owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching authorities unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the potential for subsequent penalties and false alarms.</p>
