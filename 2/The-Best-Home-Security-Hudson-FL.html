"As soon as the criminal activity and offence figures were adapted to appraise the basic downward trend in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were noted in particular categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually lowered criminal offense overall in the city centre."
