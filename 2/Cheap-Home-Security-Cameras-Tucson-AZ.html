<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
<p>Good picture and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand out too much. Pretty simple to install.

<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to police ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize police response to alarmed properties) a inefficient and costly method to burglary reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
