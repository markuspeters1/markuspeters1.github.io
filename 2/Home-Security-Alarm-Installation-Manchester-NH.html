If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Many modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to gain a few of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup.
