This guarantees a quick response and reduces the burglar's possibilities of success.</p>

This is NOT an agreement, rather a yearly prepay discount rate. When I ultimately entered into the camera controls, I was fairly satisfied. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the individual being seen understand they're being viewed, and you can choose to record video or photos and conserve them to your clever gadget on a whim.</p>
