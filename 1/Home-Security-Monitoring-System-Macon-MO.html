<p>Smart-home combination: A lot of outdoor cameras provide some kind of smart-home combination, such as support for Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, IFTTT (If This Then That), SmartThings, and more.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
