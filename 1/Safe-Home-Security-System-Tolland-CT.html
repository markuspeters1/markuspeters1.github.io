<p>While every property owner stresses over burglaries, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high costs, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces typically leading to incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a free smart device app that enables residents who see something suspicious to take an image and quickly send it to public safety authorities.
