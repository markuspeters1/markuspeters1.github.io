It was extremely basic to establish, as the parts are pre-paired to the base station, and it was quick to trigger when any of the sensing units were activated. We love that it comes with both external and internal sirens and will even deal with Philips Shade smart lights, too. The instructions are very extensive and the 200m range of the alarm indicates it can be utilized to secure sheds and garages along with your home.

<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage choice and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage choice conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the gadget itself.

However, this is typically a paid service and the number of hours it will save will depend upon how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
