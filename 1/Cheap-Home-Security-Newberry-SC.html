<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it instantly shut off the heater. You can immediately make the smart lights turn on to terrify away possible robbers if the motion sensors are activated.</p>
<p>Frame rate: This is another key aspect of a camera-- the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is simply a series of still images sewn together to create a motion picture.

For recommendation, "real time" is normally determined as 30 frames per second.
