The same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
