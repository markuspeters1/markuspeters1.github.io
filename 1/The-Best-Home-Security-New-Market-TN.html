<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.

<p>We required guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to secure the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating unit at 5am. The very first guard got here early so he might take a look at the whole area and speak with me about my issues. He was expert, extremely comforting and courteous. The 2nd guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the early morning to get the occasion started, he was also professional, encouraging and courteous. We were really delighted with your service and I will advise that we call on your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. Once after leaving our property in your hands, I didn't fret.</p>
