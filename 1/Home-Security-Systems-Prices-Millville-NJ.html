Bottom Line: ADT is a highly-customizable system that provides hardwired and wireless systems. We consider them the pioneers of home security and the most popular provider among homeowners.</p>
<p>GO2's custom wireless network camera systems enable surveillance without the hassle and need for within and complex circuitry. Proxim's wireless options have enabled highly dependable video surveillance networks in all corners of the world.
