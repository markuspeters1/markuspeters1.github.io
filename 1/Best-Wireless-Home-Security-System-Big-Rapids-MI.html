<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
