The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days.
