<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>

<p>Amongst IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free.

Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest option to install and all of the recorded footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
