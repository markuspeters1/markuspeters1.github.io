<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by.
