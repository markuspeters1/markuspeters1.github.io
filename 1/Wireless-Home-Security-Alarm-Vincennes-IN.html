<p>To evaluate reaction times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensing units. Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security personnel. Several cities also need an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be established to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
