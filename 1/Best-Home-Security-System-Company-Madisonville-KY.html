Alarms activated by accidental but legal entry to the property, i.e. kids returning home, guests, next-door neighbors taking care of the home while you are on getaway and delivery men do not meet the requirement for waiver.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.

Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by.
