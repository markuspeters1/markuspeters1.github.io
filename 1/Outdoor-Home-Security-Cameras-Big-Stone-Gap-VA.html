<p>The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. However suicide assaulters are clearly not deterred by camera - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can make sure - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the minimal benefits that the system may offer in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Canary has actually got over some preliminary software problems to use a very decent security camera alternative: specifically that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of view, night vision and motion signals (plus clear audio). What's more, that 90+ decibel siren makes it more of a serious security camera than some others here (though it requires to be by hand activated when you find something awry).

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
