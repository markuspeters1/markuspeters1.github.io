<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring.

Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally via 110VAC power.</p>
