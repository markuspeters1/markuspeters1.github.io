Theft avoidance is a needed precaution to ensure the safety of your belongings. An alarm system can serve several functions to this end. In some cases, its presence can serve as a deterrent-- robbers are less apt to target an area where it is most likely that they will experience such interference. In other circumstances, when they go through with the act, the alarm can serve to alert people in the location (as well as the authorities) that something is amiss. This ensures a fast action and reduces the burglar's possibilities of success.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never ever matches the maker's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for brief battery life by far.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to attend to the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that knows the keys can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>Just like the Nest, if you include a paid membership to this camera, it becomes a lot smarter (and, minus some subtle distinctions, the membership prepares put the Circle 2 on a par with the Nest in regards to features).

The Circle Safe Basic plan supplies 14 days of video storage for $4 per month per camera (compared with $5 for 5 days for Nest Aware). The $10 Premium plan bumps that up to 31 days of storage (compared to $10 for 10 days for Nest Aware) and adds motion zones, filter options, and the ability to distinguish in between people and other items.</p>
