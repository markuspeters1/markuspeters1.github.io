<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
