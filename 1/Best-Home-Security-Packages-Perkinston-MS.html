<h3>Wireless Security Company Perkinston MS 39573</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a regular camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the fact, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and take up a lot of recording storage area. A lot, in fact, that they need about four times the hard disk space of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
