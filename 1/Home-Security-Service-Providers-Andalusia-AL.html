This look is recognizable to almost everybody and hence functions as a deterrent to unwanted individuals. The hope is crooks and burglars go in other places rather if security cameras are noticeable. That being said, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism because of their obvious appearance.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
