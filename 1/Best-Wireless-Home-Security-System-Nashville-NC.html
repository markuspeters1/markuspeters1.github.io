<p>We still believe the Ring Alarm is an excellent option for a cheap home security system with clever home support. But maybe avoid the cameras for now. Hard disk drive storage is safe, secure, and practical, with lots of systems using expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll require to manually eliminate to transfer the data? Does it go to your smart device, or upload to services like Dropbox?
