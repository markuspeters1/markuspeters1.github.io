As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
