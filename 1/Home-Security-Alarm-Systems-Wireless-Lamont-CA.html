Just moved to Los Angeles and I believe I'm going to purchase a home security system for the first time.

Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
