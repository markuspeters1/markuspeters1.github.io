<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Learning permits someone to discover what they are searching for without having to search through hours of worthless video footage.  Imagine a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we just type police" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep learning video search, you now have an effective option for collecting and catching wrongdoers evidence.</p>
<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? Having a hardwired security system installed may be a much easier and more inexpensive choice if so.

While wireless home security systems are popular and understood for a much easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more reputable because they aren't based on interference.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
