<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal construction.

Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
