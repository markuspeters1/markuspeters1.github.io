All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, utilize proximity sensing units in the windows and doors as the first line of defense versus possible burglars, and alarm systems transmit info to a main monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>While not an important requirement for a home security system, all top companies offer a variety of camera choices as add-ons. Property owners can choose from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can tape-record footage when an alarm is activated, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, nanny cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be incorporated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic knowledge of alarm is useful.
