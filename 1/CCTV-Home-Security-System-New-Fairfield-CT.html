<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
