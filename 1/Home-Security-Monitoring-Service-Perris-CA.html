<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, must offer a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage).
