By simply purchasing the camera, you currently get things like custom activity zones, and TP-Link is fairly generous with its free cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history). Audio enhances video surveillance to much better spot and translate incidents in real-time. As an added advantage, an audio option can be quickly incorporated into the existing security system.
