In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>

A second alarm signal-- received in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor needs to ask for a dispatch right away. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
