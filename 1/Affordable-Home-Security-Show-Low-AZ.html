<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the very same smarts and more comprehensive 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , since its image quality is still exceptional, and it's somewhat much better worth - though its rate is still its achilles' heel.
