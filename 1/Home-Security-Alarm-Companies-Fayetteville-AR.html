<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not need a new keypad. Using multiple sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources.

A second alarm signal-- received in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe ought to a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
