<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of complimentary storage, and utilize two AA batteries that can last as much as 2 years. However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.

<p>Expert installation was almost the only way to put in a home security system 15 years back. Innovation has come such a long way that Do It Yourself systems can offer the same level of security (and typically more) with a self installed system.

For somebody searching for a more complex setup like home automation, or someone that desires a trained expert to make the recommendation for the setup, specialist installation is a terrific option. We've found that the majority of people that were uncertain about self setting up a home security system actually wound up finding the process extremely easy.
