<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
