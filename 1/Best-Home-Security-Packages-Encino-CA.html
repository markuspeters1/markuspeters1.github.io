What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in ideal conditions like brilliant sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in certain situations such as baby-sitter web cams or signing in on a pet, though when aiming to collect proof of a criminal offense they typically come up short.</p>
<p>Another way to save recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).
