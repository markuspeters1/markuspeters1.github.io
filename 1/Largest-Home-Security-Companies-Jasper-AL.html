<p>Frontpoint's Interactive bundle offers you home automation control so you can access and control your lights, locks, and thermostat all from your mobile phone.

The terrorists were taped on several CCTV cameras, but sadly they were neither seen nor obstructed prior to they were able to perform the attacks.</p>
<p>The second wireless function pertains to how your security system communicates with the alarm monitoring station. Older security systems would utilize a home phone line to dial out" and interact with the alarm monitoring station. However, lots of families no longer utilize a phone line in their home. So, how do we get your alarm to interact with the monitoring station? Much in the very same method you do - we can connect through the web or by means of a wireless mobile phone signal.</p>
