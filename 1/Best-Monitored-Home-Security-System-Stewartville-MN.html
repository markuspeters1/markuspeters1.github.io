Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private security guard. Several cities also need a permit to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
