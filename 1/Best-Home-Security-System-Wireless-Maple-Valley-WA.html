The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, and so we might revisit this review.
