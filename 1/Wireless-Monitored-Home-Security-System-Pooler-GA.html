<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
