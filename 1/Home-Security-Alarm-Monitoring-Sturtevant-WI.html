Not just is the Arlo quick to choose moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple years ago, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of huge names using pricey, rigid plans with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements.
