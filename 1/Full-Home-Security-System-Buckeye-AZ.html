<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Wireless is the way of the future. Some leading home security companies offer expert installation, while others preconfigure your system at the factory and ship to your door for just DIY setup. See the best wireless options below. Frontpoint Security provides a easy and wise  monitored home security service, using a wide variety of different wireless devices.

In addition to working as a deterrent, cameras can signal authorities of criminal activities as they take place, which can allow officers to respond quickly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011). On a larger scale, making use of CCTV likewise presents the possibility of aiding in the criminal justice system, as video footage of a criminal activity may help in prosecutions and investigations (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
