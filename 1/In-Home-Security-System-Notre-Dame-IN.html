<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
