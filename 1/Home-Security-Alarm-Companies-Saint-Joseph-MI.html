In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, usually via 110VAC power.</p>
