<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
