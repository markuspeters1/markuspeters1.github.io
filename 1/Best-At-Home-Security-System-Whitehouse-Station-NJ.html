The majority of security companies sell disaster home security devices, and wise versions of these gadgets can notify you on your phone when there's something going on. With those types of stats, it is no wonder home security systems are on people's minds. But in a world where technology seems to progress every month, home security systems have ventured into new territory: wise alarms.</p>
<p>One of the best elements of this alarm is that it has an extremely advanced motion sensor. Due to the fact that it utilizes infrared sensing units and mass detection to differentiate in between people and other inanimate objects or smaller living things, it only gets set off when a human comes in close distance. If your motion sensor is set off, you get a notice in your smart device app. There's no latency so you get alerted immediately so you can take instant actions such as setting off a loud alarm, contacting the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to speak with the potential intruders.</p>

A self-monitored system doesn't mean a house owner needs to compromise any features. Homeowners can personalize the system to their needs and can decide to have the system expertly set up or do it themselves. Unlike other monitoring options, self-monitored systems don't have a monthly monitoring charge.</p>
