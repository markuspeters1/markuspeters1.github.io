<p>The genuine factor cameras are normally deployed is to decrease much pettier crimes. But it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have not minimized crime. "Once the crime and offense figures were adjusted to appraise the basic down pattern in offences and criminal activities," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were noted in certain classifications however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had minimized criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
