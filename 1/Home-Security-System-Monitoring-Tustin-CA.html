It's a flexible type of security technology, due to the fact that sensing units can be moved and included with relative ease.

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the patio by a licensed electrical expert (who happens to be my spouse).

The only outdoor security camera that's currently offered is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is terrific for watching on visitors and bundle deliveries, however it leaves other parts of your backyard susceptible. If you have a big backyard or sheds to protect, this system might not be the best fit. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not need a base station-- it connects straight to any Wi-Fi network. However you can link the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is readily available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
