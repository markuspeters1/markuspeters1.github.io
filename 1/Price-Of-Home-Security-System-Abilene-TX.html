<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors safeguard your security system against short-term surges that can enter through Air Conditioning power lines, telephone lines and remote notification zones. Home automation is hassle-free and simple, and wireless systems help you automate your home that a lot easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home devices are by their very nature wireless, and most home security companies provide a home automation package with an app to remotely control whatever on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have actually wired home automation, because you can, but automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and more difficult to encrypt. It isn't really smart. Wireless gadgets interact more securely and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you choose monitoring).</p>

Another location where Arlo excels is customer service.

We called consumer support, which provided a complimentary replacement unit-- despite the fact that the service warranty had long since expired.</p>
