<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on created to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a light indoors or trigger an external siren when the camera identifies motion.</p>
