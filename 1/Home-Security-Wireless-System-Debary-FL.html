<h3>Top Home Security Companies in Florida</h3>
<p>You are probably still questioning whether you should think about getting the wired system or the wireless system. While the conventional wired systems are a possibility, they aren't always the very best choice. The wireless systems tend to be a better choice for many homes today. Since smart home security doesn't simply have to have to do with keeping potential intruders away. Secret fobs, smartphone GPS and even smart face-recognition software can help keep an eye on the kids or a senior relative and let you understand when they get home safely, or if they leave the house unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
