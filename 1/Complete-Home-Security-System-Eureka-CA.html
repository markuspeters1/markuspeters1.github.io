<h3>CCTV Home Security System in California</h3>

We actually enjoyed utilizing Nest Secure for home protection and automation, however bear in mind that it can get costly if you do not already have a Nest smart home community set up.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
