Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and sometimes, entirely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options because their design enables minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is better to have actually a camera equipped with infrared detection rather than motion detection. Because typically times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will provide more accurate and less regular alerts.</p>

<p>No power? No worries. Wireless security systems work even if there is a power blackout in the home. Wired systems can not run when an outage takes place, leaving the home unguarded.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
