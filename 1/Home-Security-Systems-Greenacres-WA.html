The regulation requires monitored burglar alarms in unincorporated Douglas County, the city of Castle Pines and the town of Larkspur to be registered and pay an annual $40 permit fee. The alarm installation or monitoring company, not the home owner or company owner, is needed to sign up the alarm and pay the fee. Burglar alarms are planned to prevent break-in and to assist police capture intruders, which, if done dependably and effectively, benefits the general public at large. If, however, burglar alarms are inefficient or unreliable, the drain on police resources from reacting to them might outweigh their benefits. Here we examine the evidence of burglar alarms' contribution to these two worthwhile goals.</p>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible offenders are less likely to commit crime if they think they are being watched or have a higher threat of being captured. This is likewise referred to as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to offend can be minimized by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being captured, increasing the effort to devote the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering provocations that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the wrongdoer needs to understand the added surveillance for it to accomplish its preferred result.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract might be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
