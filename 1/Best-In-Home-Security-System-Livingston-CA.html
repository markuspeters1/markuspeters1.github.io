<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make clients stick with them longer, because switching monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>Alarm monitoring belongs to a total home security system.

The control panel interacts with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, doors and window sensors, and motion sensors, to discover an intruder or something that is incorrect. Then, the monitoring company right away sets to action, connecting with you and alerting the authorities.</p>
