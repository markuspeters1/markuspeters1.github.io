For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make consumers stay with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software and firmware.

Remember: A home larger than 4,500 square feet is typically better off using a wired system.</p>

In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power.</p>
