<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>

<p>Many home security systems offer extra sensing units that offer protection beyond keeping out burglars. These sensing units help you safeguard your home from things like floods and freezing temperatures. Smart sensors take details from the physical environments to discover changes in the environment that might signify trouble. Some security systems also use smart sensing units to listen" for CO and smoke detector. When those sensing units hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are alerted and emergency situation assistance is dispatched if required.</p>
<p>Their basic plan uses a 2GIG control board with backup battery, color touch-screen, cellular communicator with 2-way voice and internal siren.
