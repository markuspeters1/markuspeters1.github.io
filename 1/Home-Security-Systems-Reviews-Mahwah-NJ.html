<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to break-in reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
