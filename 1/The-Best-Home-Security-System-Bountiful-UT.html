<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
