Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal security personnel. Several cities likewise need a license to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are created to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
