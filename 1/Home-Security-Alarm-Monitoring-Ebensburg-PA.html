<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a declaration saying the system would signal users when it identified any kind of interference. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the problem.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>A good professional alarm monitoring company will have fast reaction times, which is very important for your safety and security. Research studies have revealed that roughly 70 percent of break-ins that are not finished are because of the sound of an alarm. As soon as the cameras were linked, we monitored day and night activities, including the comings and goings of two grownups, one kid, and a dog.
