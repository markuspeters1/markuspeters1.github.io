Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by.
