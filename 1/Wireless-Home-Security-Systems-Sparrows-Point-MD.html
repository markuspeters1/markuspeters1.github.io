<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic sound wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi information. (You should play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines groan, felines scream, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
