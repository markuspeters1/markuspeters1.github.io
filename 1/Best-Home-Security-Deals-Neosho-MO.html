You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people may find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies."
