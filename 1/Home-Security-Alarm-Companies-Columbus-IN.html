<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit restricted to suggest as a top choice.</p>
