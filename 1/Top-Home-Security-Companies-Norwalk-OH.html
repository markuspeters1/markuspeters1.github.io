These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder straight which then connects to the internet and a router.
