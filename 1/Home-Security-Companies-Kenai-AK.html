<p>CCTV cameras are put in areas where they are believed to be most reliable, which typically includes highly inhabited towns, town hall, parking lot, or different other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we tested, and it uses two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing.
