<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the producer's stats because this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to suggest as a top choice.</p>

The majority of cameras need an Air Conditioner connection, which suggests you will not have the ability to place them simply anywhere.
