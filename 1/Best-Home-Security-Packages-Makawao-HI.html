<p>While every homeowner stresses over burglaries, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often resulting in false alarms. ELERTS is a complimentary smart device app that allows citizens who see something suspicious to take an image and rapidly send it to public safety officials. For example, a public transit rider might observe someone acting suspiciously. Many people are fiddling, surfing or texting with their mobile phones.
