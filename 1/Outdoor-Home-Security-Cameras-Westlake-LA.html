<p>No false alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the cops for a false alarm. Considering that the house owner supervises of the system, police are only called if there's a real emergency. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will contact cops if a property owner can't confirm a false alarm.
