<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
