<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely enjoy it. Fantastic clarity. I wished to set up viewing on my cell phone but had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter signals, for example. However, those features come at a comparatively high price: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for 1 month of video history.

<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems offer easy Do It Yourself installation, other companies provide (and in some cases require) expert installation. Professional installation is readily available for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end.
