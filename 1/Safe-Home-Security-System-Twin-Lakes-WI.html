<h3>Security Monitoring Equipment Twin Lakes WI 53181</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the maker's statistics given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest perpetrator for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit restricted to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>Arlo builds excellent home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company is capable of. While it doesn't have the eye-popping 4K resolution of the Arlo Ultra, it provides wonderful video quality and much of that more-expensive camera's other signature features for less. And it can be released indoors or out. The Brinks Home Security system is available in two package options. The Home Complete design is $29 monthly. For those who wish to take advantage of higher-end features such as Live Video Streaming and Cloud Video Storage, the monthly charge is $39.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
